Impacts/metrics

1 Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE is a commonly used metric in statistics and machine learning to measure the average squared difference between the actual (observed) values and the predicted values. It is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of regression models. MSE gives more weight to larger errors due to the squaring operation, which can be advantageous when you want to penalize larger deviations more significantly. The formula for MSE is:

MSE = (1/n) * Σ(actual - predicted)^2

2 .Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE is a variation of the MSE that involves taking the square root of the MSE. The RMSE provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in the same units as the original data, making it more interpretable. Like MSE, RMSE is often used to assess the accuracy of regression models. The formula for RMSE is:

RMSE = √MSE R-squared (R2) Score:

3.R2 score
R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is explained by the independent variables (features) in a regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data.

Language- why Python and Not R ?

Python has gained significant popularity in the field of Machine Learning (ML) over R for several reasons:

1. Rich Libraries and Ecosystem: Python has a wide range of well-maintained and comprehensive libraries for machine learning and data analysis, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras. These libraries offer efficient implementations of various ML algorithms, making it easier for developers to experiment, implement, and deploy models.

2. Community and Support: Python has a larger and more active community compared to R. This means that you can find more resources, tutorials, and community support when facing challenges during ML development. The community's engagement also results in quicker updates, bug fixes, and new features for libraries.

3. Flexibility and General-purpose Language:Python is a general-purpose programming language, making it versatile beyond ML. You can easily integrate ML into larger software projects, web applications, and other domains. This flexibility is especially useful for developing end-to-end applications that involve both data processing and machine learning components.

4. Ease of Learning and Readability: Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability, which reduces the learning curve for beginners and makes code more maintainable. This is crucial when working on collaborative ML projects or sharing code with colleagues.

5. Integration with Data Processing Tools: Python integrates well with data processing libraries like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, enabling seamless data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in the same language used for ML tasks.

6. Deployment and Productionization: Python's versatility extends to model deployment. Platforms like Flask and Django make it straightforward to create APIs for serving ML models. Containers and cloud services can also be used to scale and manage deployed models.

7. Popularity in Industry: Python's popularity extends beyond the academic and research communities. Many industries and companies prefer Python for ML due to its practicality, which results in a higher demand for Python ML skills in the job market.

While R still has its own strengths, such as being statistically focused and having excellent visualization capabilities, Python's broader ecosystem, ease of use, and industry acceptance have propelled it to the forefront of the ML landscape. The choice between Python and R often depends on specific use cases, personal preference, and existing expertise.
